### Hi there 👋

- ⚡ I'm a Dad, Husband, Developer 
- :octocat: Honestly, I'm making a lot of changes to my priorities as compared to a year from 2022. 
- After meticulous reading and comprehension of web development, I decided to first launch a basic blog. 
- 🤞🏻From there, it should act as my main medium of communication of all the projects and endeavour I work on.
